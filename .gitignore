#The .gitignore file is a special file used in Git repositories to specify which files and directories should be ignored by Git. It is a text file that #contains patterns matching the names of files and directories you want Git to ignore.

#Structure and Syntax
#Each line in a .gitignore file specifies a pattern.
#Blank lines are ignored.
#Lines starting with # are comments.
#Patterns can specify file names, directories, or file types.

#Common Patterns
#Ignoring Specific Files:
#secret.txt (ignores secret.txt file in the root directory)

#Ignoring Directories:
logs/ (ignores the entire logs directory)
build/ (ignores the entire build directory)

#Ignoring File Types:
#*.log (ignores all .log files)
#*.tmp (ignores all .tmp files)

Ignoring Files in Specific Directories:
#dir/*.txt (ignores all .txt files in dir directory)

#Negating Patterns:
#!important.log (does not ignore important.log even if *.log is ignored)

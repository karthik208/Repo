GIT CMDS:

Set Up Git Configuration
Configure your Git username and email. Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

E:\All Files\D\MY_CODES> git config --global user.name "karthik208"
E:\All Files\D\MY_CODES> git config --global user.email "karthikarunagiri001@gmail.com"

Initialize a Git Repository
Navigate to the directory where your PySpark word count script is located and initialize a Git repository:
E:\All Files\D\MY_CODES>git init
Initialized empty Git repository in E:/All Files/D/MY_CODES/.git/

Create a README File (Optional)
It is a good practice to include a README file in your repository:
E:\All Files\D\MY_CODES>echo "# PySpark Word Count" >> README.md

# Add your script and README file to the repository
git add word_count.py README.md

Commit Your Changes
Commit the changes to your local repository:
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add PySpark word count script"

git remote add origin https://github.com/karthik208/Repo.git
git branch -M main

Push Your Code to GitHub
Push your local commits to the remote repository:
E:\All Files\D\MY_CODES>git push -u origin main
